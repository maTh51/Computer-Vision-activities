# Camera Calibration

Task: Implement an algorithm in python to estimate the intrinsics and extrinsics parameters (f_x, T_x, T_y, T_z  and matrix R) of "your" camera.
* See pages 129-132, Trucco e Verri
* You need the print the calibration pattern (see the attached pdf)
* Please note that you also must to implement the code to compute two scale factors: \lambda and \alpha (see details in the book).

What to submitt: Python notebook with the code, results and discussion showing the results for the following comparisons
1. Compare with the calibration toolbox presented in the classroom
2. Compare with the na√Øve calibration presented in the classroom
3. Your Implementation with the extraction of the eigenvector using SVD function
