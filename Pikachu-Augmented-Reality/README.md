# Pikachu Augmented Reality

The objective of this work is, from a video, to find the intrinsic parameters of the camera, detect and locate targets in the frames of a video and insert a three-dimensional cube and a 3D model of a Pikachu in the scene. To accomplish this task, especially functions from OpenCV and OpenGL, as well as Numpy, PIL and PyGame should be used.
