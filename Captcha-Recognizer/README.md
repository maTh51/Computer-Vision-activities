# Captcha Recognizer

This work aims to implement a method that recognizes all six characters of captchas images. It was chosen to implement a CNN, with 4 convolution layers and 2 dense layers. Each captcha was divided into 6 blocks, each trying to contain one character. Then, we train the network with 15 epochs, and evaluate the model.
