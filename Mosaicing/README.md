# Mosaicing

A program for generating mosaics in three steps should be implemented:
1. The first step will be to calculate the homography matrices between two consecutive images. For this, the student must detect SIFT keypoints, extract the descriptors (SIFT and BRIEF) and finally match the corresponding keypoint pairs. The set of pairs must be used for the estimation of the homography matrix. To calculate the homography, the student can use the OpenCV function findHomography();
2. The second step is to transform the images using the matrices estimated in the previous step;
3. The third step is to perform the blending, reducing the artifacts generated by the transformation and the difference in lighting in the acquisition of each image. The blending function must be implemented by the student. 

The student must implement two versions of the warpPerspective function perform the blending using:
1. Average between pixels: (P1 + P2)/2;
2. Feathering: (P1 × w1 + P2 × w2)/(w1 + w2).

The student must evaluate its implementation in a qualitative way, reporting the final image with the analysis of the problems found in each approach. Show the results for the two versions of the warpPerspective function and for the keypoint detector and descriptor combinations: (SIFT+SIFT) and (SIFT and BRIEF).
